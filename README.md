  *<ins>Tablets:</ins>*

Performance: Tablets receive the highest number of emails but perform poorly in terms of engagement and conversions.

They exhibit the highest bounce rates, suggesting potential issues like outdated or invalid email addresses or less usage for email access.

Opportunity: Tablets may require different content formatting or targeting strategies to increase engagement.
 
  *<ins>Desktops:</ins>*
  
Performance: Desktops have a significant number of emails sent and a 100% open rate, indicating strong engagement.

They have the highest click rate (1,244) and conversions (799).

Challenges: Desktops also have the highest number of unsubscribers, signaling potential dissatisfaction with the content or frequency of emails.

  *<ins>Mobiles:</ins>*

Performance: Mobile devices also see a 100% open rate, highlighting their importance for reaching clients.

Despite a lower click rate (771) compared to desktops, mobiles still deliver a substantial conversion rate (477).

Opportunity: Mobile optimization can further enhance performance.

*<ins>Client Segmentation</ins>*
  *<ins>Lead Clients:</ins>*

Lead clients receive the highest number of emails and exhibit stronger engagement metrics (open, click, and conversion rates) than customer clients.

They also record higher unsubscription and bounce rates, indicating varying levels of satisfaction.

Lead clients seem to be at a more dynamic stage of interaction with the brand, offering opportunities for conversion through nurturing.

  *<ins>Customer Clients:</ins>*

Customer clients receive fewer emails but exhibit more stable engagement with lower unsubscription and bounce rates.

This stability could indicate content alignment or satisfaction with the communication. 

**<ins> Recommendations </ins>**

1. Focus on optimizing emails for mobile and desktop, given their high engagement. Investigate the reasons for poor tablet performance.
2. Refine email strategies for lead clients to maintain engagement while addressing unsubscriptions and bounces.
